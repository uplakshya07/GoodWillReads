            <h2>Welcome to Good Will Read!</h2><br><br>
            <p>
                Good Will Read is an online bookstore with a mission to financially support local, independent bookstores.
                We believe that bookstores are essential to a healthy culture. They’re where authors can connect with
                readers, where we discover new writers, where children get hooked on the thrill of reading that can last
                a
                lifetime. They’re also anchors for our downtowns and communities.
                As more and more people buy their books online, we wanted to create an easy, convenient way for you to
                get
                your books and support bookstores at the same time.<br><br>

            <h2>A Message From Our Co-Founder</h2><br><br>
            <p>
                When I was in second grade, I discovered the Hardy Boys series. Ever since, I've loved to read — both
                for
                fun
                and to improve my mind. And I'm always looking for the next great book.<br><br>One afternoon while I was
                scanning a friend's bookshelf for ideas, it struck me: when I want to know what books
                to read, I'd rather turn to a friend than any random person or bestseller list.<br><br>So I decided to
                build
                a website – a place where I could see my friends' bookshelves and learn about what they
                thought of all their books. Elizabeth, my co-founder (and now my wife) wrote the site copy and I wrote
                the
                code.
                We started in my living room, motivated by the belief that there was a better way to discover and
                discuss
                good
                books, and that we could build it.<br><br>Goodreads is that site. It is a place where you can see what
                your
                friends are reading and vice versa. You can
                create "bookshelves" to organize what you've read (or want to read). You can comment on each other's
                reviews.
                You can find your next favorite book. And on this journey with your friends you can explore new
                territory,
                gather information, and expand your mind.<br><br>Knowledge is power, and power is best shared among
                readers.<br><br>
